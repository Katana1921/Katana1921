                <p class="text-muted text-left ">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.It is a great place to visit with family and friends.STAY ALERT YOU MIGHT MEET SLAYY POINT.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left ">It's a wonderful place.You should hire a tour guide so it will be better to understand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of â‚¹15 for Indians but about â‚¹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.You absolutely must visit.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left ">One of the oldest Monastery in Darjeeling. It is situated in a peaceful and beautiful landscape just 15 minutes walk from Ghoom Railway Station. We can see religious Gods and Goddesses paintings believed by Buddhism inside which can give spiritual power to one who prays there with a clean heart. From the compound of Monastery on a clear day one can have a scenery of hills all around which is great for nature lovers.</p>
